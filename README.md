Alternatively, you can install android studio and VSC extension for flutter and dart and use the emulator to see the app on a device.

## About

This is a simple application reading some repeating Json data with a unique id and displaying that data in a pleasing manner.

The state management solution Provider was used to create a model for a basket object where you can add quantities of items and see how much they would cost to be delivered.
flutter is then used to display the data from this basket model along with the repeating Json data.

The application is intuitive to use and was based of just-eat.ie's user interface.
